# Purple Teaming Notes

# Concepts first

Simmulations ≠ Emmulation

Simmulations = Effects

Emmulation = Processes

Gate/Time Gate: WHEN defenders or systems SHOULD detect an adversarial emulation

# Questions to be answered before engaging in Purple Teaming

1. Who wants to hack me?
2. How might they do it?
3. Are my controls set to stop it?
4. How can we test them?

# Phase 1: Orientation

![Untitled](Purple%20Teaming%20Notes%20e93a4ca80356476096ccaa4dfe0b5aa4/Untitled.png)

Orient to the target (The Org)

Competitors, verticals, geo, political, Business value (Think as an attacker). Why and how it does what it does

Understand the Env:

What am I testing against? Architecture, systems, Software, etc. Accuracy of information (Assets and inventory) is KEY. 

Understand the Threats:

Terrain analysis: Understand Architecture and how it supports the org's mission. Prioritize assets > Business outcome/value. Infrastructure chains that lets the Org add value. Have a map for high priority assets/processes. 

Threat selection. WHo's after us? What threats are after us? Crimeware, APTs, commodity malware, etc. Prioritize for 2 or 3 threats. 

Know controls:

What's the intersection of security for critical controls/assets? What are our controls? Do we have enabled security controls? Are they updated? Are they running correctly?

## Phase 2: Planning & Preparation

![Untitled](Purple%20Teaming%20Notes%20e93a4ca80356476096ccaa4dfe0b5aa4/Untitled%201.png)

Establish Goals:

Planning what's the intended outcome? Validate controls? Testing capabilities? Baseline controls? Testing against threats? BIG scope

Establish emulation control Measures:

Limiting the scope to subnets, identities, people (Fence off those controls). Present management the data they need to implement security measures. Qualify and quantify if possible. Business and Org's goals. This needs to be prioritized bc it needs investment, so it needs to make sense. 
Limit the no. of controls for testing. Pick a couple of threats and test controls

TIMING AND SEQUENCING

Schedule planning and execution:

For engagements, we need a plan. What are we expecting? What reporting could look like? 

Battle rythm:

Critical: List of things than need to be done. Effects, detections and protection actions being taken care of. Reporting to Business, defenders and IT. 

Define the Gates:

Importance: We need to move the needle and understand the value of the exercise, so this are kind of the milestones of the exercises. 

# Phase 3: Action

![Untitled](Purple%20Teaming%20Notes%20e93a4ca80356476096ccaa4dfe0b5aa4/Untitled%202.png)

Execute the Emulation Plan…

and make sure it counts. You’ll have found a way to get your emulations executed professionally and ensuring the debriefs happen is paramount

Manage the Ebb and Flow

This is the iterative and on-call portion of the exercise. You’ll quickly see where SOC teams and red teams alike find their friction points and the art to this Purple stuff is in nudging the schedule and emulation timing to take advantage of it. EXCON should be everywhere at once, assessing processes, information flows, and general competency on both sides.

Exercise Judgement

Safety, Exercise Flow, and PRODUCTION are all subject to a degree of risk when emulating badness. EXCON should be an experienced practitioner-leader who knows Red, Blue, and Intel as fluently as IT architecture (very).

…and remember, No Discomfort, No Expansion

# Phase 4 - Reporting & Remediation

![Untitled](Purple%20Teaming%20Notes%20e93a4ca80356476096ccaa4dfe0b5aa4/Untitled%203.png)

- [ ]  **Debrief in Detail and Report**

Hot Wash and Deliver the Initial OutbriefEvery day gets a rundown of catches and misses with both red and blue in the room. Address the how and why of each, be candid, call out individual successes and failures constructively.

Produce Audience-Appropriate Reports

Every stakeholder has both a boss and a job to handle; produce reports accordingly. Some technical reports will require extra time and analysis to make useful with compensating controls and mitigation plans. Some EXSUMs will need savvy VPs to weigh in and executize© things into the language of risk as opposed to vulnerabilities in libc. Talk to people about the things they care about.

- [ ]  **Mitigate and Revalidate Control Gaps**

Assess and Enact MitigationsAsk yourself and your team: Wherever the pipeline failed, how do we fix it and what are the best compensating controls to stand between now and that fix? Where do controls so repeatedly overlap as to lose value in maintaining both rather than dropping one and compensating somewhere else? Security Architecture analysis comes back into play as red and blue refine both failed processes and tech. A mitigation is anything that The Risk Mitigation Plan is a framework for describing and prioritizing exercise outputs.

**Revalidate Updated Controls**

Startup whatever Red capability you used to execute the emulation plan and throw it at your fresh mitigations to see how they took.

- [ ]  **Plan for future iterations**

Identify Persistent Gaps

There will still be holes, but they shouldn’t be so big or numerous as before, and you’ve stepped up your team’s capabilities to the point that the ones you filled are matters of policy and procedure to cover rather than intense effort. The ones left over are the subject of compensating controls, longer-term investments, and the starting point for the next round.

Level Up The Next Exercise

A successful Purple Teaming exercise so plainly demonstrates value that every stakeholder is going to want more. This is a process that finds maximum ROI when executed in a spiral of increasing scenario complexity. Any Blue team becomes purple with the proper measure of Red capabilities mixed in.
